## Mini Project 8 :page_facing_up: 

## :ballot_box_with_check: Requirements
* Take an existing Python script for data processing</br>
* Rewrite it in Rust</br>
* Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage

## :ballot_box_with_check: To-do List
* __Understanding database connection__: To understand how to rewrite Python script in Rust and figure out why Rust is used.</br>

## :ballot_box_with_check: Dataset
* `births14.csv`
  - Every year, the US releases to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in the country. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample of 1,000 cases from the data set released in 2014.
  - A data frame with 1,000 observations on the following 13 variables.</br>
  - The whole dataset is described in [here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=births14).
